# My Projects
During my first semster, there were many labs that I completed that improved my programming knowledge and skills. Out of all the labs I did, the following labs were the most impactfull on my growth:
### Lab 3

For Lab 3, I was tasked with creating a menu system in Visual Studio 2022 where the user would be able to run a task from a list of options.

Below is what Main looks like behind the scenes:  
``` C#
        static Int32 Selection = 0;
        // static bool Loop = true;
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            do
            {
                switch (Selection)
                {
                    case 0:
                        Menu();
                        break;
                    case 1:
                        Rectangle();
                        break;
                    case 2:
                        Collatz();
                        break;
                    case 3:
                        Dollar();
                        break;
                    case 4:
                        Oldest();
                        break;
                    case 5:
                        HiLo();
                        break;
                    case 6:

                        break;
                }
            } while (Selection !< 6); // Any number that is 6 or above will end the program
            Selection = 0;
            Console.WriteLine("Thank you for using this program");
        }
```
The user would input a number, which would then call a specific function by utilizing a **`switch`**. For example, if I were to type 1, it would call the rectangle function.

Below is the code to input the measurements for the rectangles in order to calculate and compare the areas:
``` C#
static void Rectangle()
{
    // Define rectangle Measurements
    Double Rectangle1Length;
    Double Rectangle1Width;
    Double Rectangle1Area;
    Double Rectangle2Length;
    Double Rectangle2Width;
    Double Rectangle2Area;

    // Ask the user to specify the measurements for Rectangle #1 and Rectangle #2 in order to compare their areas.
    Console.WriteLine("You have selected 1. Areas of Rectangles");
    Console.WriteLine("What is the length of Rectangle #1?");
    Rectangle1Length = CheckNumber();
    Console.WriteLine("What is the width of Rectangle #1?");
    Rectangle1Width = CheckNumber();
    Console.WriteLine("What is the length of Rectangle #2?");
    Rectangle2Length = CheckNumber();
    Console.WriteLine("What is the width of Rectangle #2?");
    Rectangle2Width = CheckNumber();

    // Calculate areas of both rectangles
    Rectangle1Area = Rectangle1Length * Rectangle1Width;
    Rectangle2Area = Rectangle2Length * Rectangle2Width;

    // Find which rectangle is bigger or if they are equal
    if (Rectangle1Area > Rectangle2Area)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Rectangle #1 has a greater area");
        Return();
    }
    else
    {
        if (Rectangle2Area == Rectangle1Area)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Rectangle #2 and Rectangle #1 have the same area");
            Return();
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Rectangle #2 has a greater area");
            Return();
        }
    }
    Selection = 0;
}
```
Once the method is finished, it will return to the **'switch'** and prompt the user to input another number in order to call a function yet again.

It will continue to do this until the user inputs the number 6 or any number higher than that. This would result in the program displaying a thank you message, before ending.
#### **What I learned**
From this lab, I learned how to properly use a switch and how to properly implement function calls.

### End of Semester Game Project
For this project, we had to use everything that Larry had taught us during the semester to create a console app game using Visual Studio 2022. He also told us:

> "To earn full marks on this assignmnet, you'll have to do more than just copy and paste what we have learnt so far." -Larry going over the assignment instructions

From while loops, to functions, to console background color, we had to incorporate as many elements as possible and include a movement system that would allow for the cursor position to go up, down, left, or right. I began to brainstorm several ideas, and went with something I thought would be interesting to make.

My idea for the Game Project was to make something similair to the randomly generating mines from Minesweeper, and make the player navigate around them to collect an object and get the highest score possible. I named my project *Mine Maze*, due to the nature of how the game was played.
