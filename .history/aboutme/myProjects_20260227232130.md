# My Projects
During my first semster, there were many labs that I completed that improved my programming knowledge and skills. Out of all the labs I did, the following labs were the most impactfull on my growth:
### Lab 3
For Lab 3, I was tasked with creating a menu system where the user would be able to select a task from a list to execute.

Below is what main looks like behind the scenes:
``` C#
        static Int32 Selection = 0;
        // static bool Loop = true;
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            do
            {
                switch (Selection)
                {
                    case 0:
                        Menu();
                        break;
                    case 1:
                        Rectangle();
                        break;
                    case 2:
                        Collatz();
                        break;
                    case 3:
                        Dollar();
                        break;
                    case 4:
                        Oldest();
                        break;
                    case 5:
                        HiLo();
                        break;
                    case 6:

                        break;
                }
            } while (Selection !< 6); // Any number that is 6 or above will end the program
            Selection = 0;
            Console.WriteLine("Thank you for using this program");
        }
```
The user would input a number, which would then call a function by utilizing a **`switch`**. For example, if I were to type 1, it would call the rectangle function.

Below is the code to calculate and compare the areas:
``` C#
static void Rectangle()
{
    // Define rectangle Measurements
    Double Rectangle1Length;
    Double Rectangle1Width;
    Double Rectangle1Area;
    Double Rectangle2Length;
    Double Rectangle2Width;
    Double Rectangle2Area;

    // Ask the user to specify the measurements for Rectangle #1 and Rectangle #2 in order to compare their areas.
    Console.WriteLine("You have selected 1. Areas of Rectangles");
    Console.WriteLine("What is the length of Rectangle #1?");
    Rectangle1Length = CheckNumber();
    Console.WriteLine("What is the width of Rectangle #1?");
    Rectangle1Width = CheckNumber();
    Console.WriteLine("What is the length of Rectangle #2?");
    Rectangle2Length = CheckNumber();
    Console.WriteLine("What is the width of Rectangle #2?");
    Rectangle2Width = CheckNumber();

    // Calculate areas of both rectangles
    Rectangle1Area = Rectangle1Length * Rectangle1Width;
    Rectangle2Area = Rectangle2Length * Rectangle2Width;

    // Find which rectangle is bigger or if they are equal
    if (Rectangle1Area > Rectangle2Area)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Rectangle #1 has a greater area");
        Return();
    }
    else
    {
        if (Rectangle2Area == Rectangle1Area)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Rectangle #2 and Rectangle #1 have the same area");
            Return();
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Rectangle #2 has a greater area");
            Return();
        }
    }
    Selection = 0;
}
```
